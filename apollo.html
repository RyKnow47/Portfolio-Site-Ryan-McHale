      <h3>Design Process</h3>
      <p>
        After conducting a competitor analysis, I was able to compare the most successful design patterns and heuristics for best usability.
        This helped me understand the best design patterns for gathering input, social, feedback, navigation and data management.
        Afer the competitive analysis was complete, I then drew the low-fidelity wirefames to get an idea of where I wnate this app to go visually.

      <h3>Ideation</h3>
      <p>
        As this was my first project in my UI design course, I leaned heavily into what I learned from my competitive analyis.
        From the analyis, I took inspiration on what design elements worked best, and incorporated them into my design.

      <h3>Wireframes</h3>
      <p>
        As soon as I had my initial designs ready, I was abl to design my wireframes. The mid-fidelity wireframes is where it started to come togther and started looking like a music app.

      <h3>Design</h3>
      <p>
        After completing my high-fidelity wireframes and adding color form my color palette, I was able to conduct user testing and
        A/B testing to ensure the colors I chose were a good choice. I also wanted to see that the app flowed well, and didn't have any
        hiccups from the user testing the app.

      <h3>Takeaways</h3>
      <p>
        As his was my first project, I quickly learned what steps I needed to focus on early in the process. For this one, I was thinking
        of colors, and typograpghy before having any idea of what the app was going to look like, or what features it was going entail.
        After concluding this project, I decided that on future projects, I need to take a more proactive approach on th style guide and branding of the app.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, this emphasized how important user testing and A/B testing is. I really liked one color variation that I tried, but no one else did.
        The main takeaway I took from this was to involve the users as early as possible in the design process. The UX part of it was just as important as the UI part of designing apps, web-apps or websites.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the next iteration of the project, I'd like to go into more detail about the podcasts part of the app, as well as the key features that make this app differentiate from the other apps in the Apple App Store.
