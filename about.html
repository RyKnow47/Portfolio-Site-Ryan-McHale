        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Ryan McHale and I'm a designer from Austin, TX. I'm a UI designer with a specializtion in Front-end Development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a graduate from St. Edwards University with a B.A. in Business Management and Organizational Leadership and Communication. I'm a career transitioned UI Designer who loves working with people and enjoys designing for people.
        </P>
        <div>
          <p>
            I’m a UI designer based in Austin, with experience in many different industries, including, aviation, automotive, both state
            and federal government and sales.
            Right after high school, I decided to enlist in the US Navy as submariner. My time onboard consisted of procurement of
            component parts, and consumable items to ensure the submarine was outfitted for a minimum of 9 months out to sea.
            In 2013, I was honorable discharged from the military and moved back to Austin, where I attended college at St.
            Edwards University. During my time here, I studied computer science, business, and leadership.
            At the start of my junior year, I started a sales and social media marketing position for a jewelry store. During my time
            there, my passion for creativity and design was born with the introduction to custom designing engagement rings and
            wedding bands for clients.
            After graduating from college, I hit the ground running at a private airline charter in Austin. During my time there, I wore
            many hats, including maintenance admin, and accounting. However, my biggest role there was acting as a project
            manager, defining problems, and working out solutions for a software to digitize and automate the aircraft maintenance
            and billing into one program.
            Once the pandemic started, I realized that working as a purchaser wasn’t ideally what I had in mind for a career. Growing
            up, I would shadow my cousin , who is a graphic designer. He would spend countless hours working on logos, websites,
            and branding for small companies and for freelancing. Thinking back to the times of looking over his shoulder and
            wishing I could do the same thing, I decided, the time was now. After spending hours of researching and comparing, I
            decided to switch my career from working for the state to being a UI designer.
            Upon finalizing my research and deciding that a career in design was the perfect thing for me, I started school for Ui
            design, and never looked back.
            Currently, I am working for the state as a purchaser and when I’m not working, I am continuing my education with frontend
            development, attending design related webinars, and participating in Daily UI projects to practice and refine my
            design skills. This also helps me keep my design skills fresh and practice design with precision. I also am learning more
            industry standard design tools, such as Figma and Sketch to ensure I can work well with others in any environment and
            collaborate with any team that I am fortunate to work with in the future.
